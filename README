reading/parsing/decoding and writing/encoding JSON for Vim using native eval
performance for reading. See autoload/json_encoding.vim

It should work fine for commonly used characters, but don't expect Vim's
encoding to fit JSON exactly.

This plugin is used by some of my plugins.

TODO: drop this library - current Vim has json_encode / decode (no idea how it encodes true /false values)
